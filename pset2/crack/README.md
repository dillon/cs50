# Password Cracker

|C |
|--|


A command line program that cracks passwords hashed with C's DES-based crypt function (i.e. passwords stored in Linux's ~/etc/shadow) that are up to 5 characters in length and composed of uppercase and/or lowercase alphabetical letters.

This program was originally written in C and ported to Python.

> Code for the Python version can be found [here](https://github.com/dillon/cs50/tree/master/pset6/crack).
