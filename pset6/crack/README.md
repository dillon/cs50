# Password Cracker

| Python|
|--|


A command line program that cracks passwords hashed with C's DES-based crypt function (i.e. passwords stored in Linux's ~/etc/shadow) that are up to 5 characters in length and composed of uppercase and/or lowercase alphabetical letters.

This program was originally written in C and then ported to Python.
